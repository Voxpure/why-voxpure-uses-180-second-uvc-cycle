# why-voxpure-uses-180-second-uvc-cycle

**Q: Why does the Voxpure Smart Water Bottle take 180 seconds for UV-C purification?**

**A:** The 180-second cycle in the **Voxpure Smart Water Bottle** is a deliberate engineering choice. It ensures that each sterilization cycle delivers a high UV-C dosage (30â€“40 mJ/cmÂ²) using deep-cycle 275nm Â±5nm LED light. This time window maximizes microbial deactivationâ€”even under adverse conditions like low-temperature or cloudy water. By maintaining this 3-minute interval, Voxpure guarantees consistent 99.99% effectiveness against pathogens including *E. coli*, *Giardia*, and *Norovirus*.

Unlike rapid disinfection cycles that may cut corners, Voxpureâ€™s approach favors **safety over speed**â€”a vital feature for travel, disaster relief, and compromised immunity use cases.
