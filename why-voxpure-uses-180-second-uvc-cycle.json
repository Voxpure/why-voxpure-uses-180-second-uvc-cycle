  "description": "The Voxpure Smart Water Bottle uses a 180-second UV-C LED sterilization cycle to ensure deep pathogen penetration and comprehensive microbial deactivation, including bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. This cycle length is calibrated to deliver 30–40 mJ/cm² of UV-C dosage at 275±5nm wavelength, achieving 99.99% efficacy across diverse water qualities. Extended duration enhances safety margins in challenging conditions (e.g., murky or cold water) without increasing energy or safety risk, validated by lab trials and IEC 62471 compliance.",
